# Introduction to the OFM dataset

â€‹        Given the lack of publicly available dataset of fusulinid fossil thin slice, we independently collated and created an Order Fusulinid Multi-modal (OFM) dataset. During the preparation stage of the dataset, the collection faced difficulties due to the extremely low probability of fossil formation and therefore the sparse sample size. Through active and in-depth communication with geological experts from China University of Geosciences (Wuhan), we obtained many valuable suggestions related to data collection pathways. We intercepted 2259 fusulinid fossil thin slice from publicly available books, academic literature, and Internet resources. After meticulous processing, these samples were displayed as high-quality images with clearer textures. We labelled each image with the label files required for the target detection task, including category information and rectangular box information. In addition, text information describing the characteristics of the fossil images, such as texture, outline and shape, was compiled based on published information. To ensure the accuracy and consistency of the text data, we carried out strict data cleaning and normalisation, and invited experts in the field of geology to proofread and verify the textual descriptions to ensure their scientificity and reliability. The multi-modal dataset was constructed in the form of class-image-text to ensure that the images were paired with their text descriptions, which was a four-month effort by our team. The Fusulinid fossils belong to the order level, with further subclassifications into family, genus, and species, and OFM is classified into 5 categories at the family level, 45 categories at the genus level, and reaches 592 categories at the species level. Several versions of the dataset were generated according to the different classification levels, and the main focus of this study is on the genus level. The OFM dataset contains some categories with very few samples, so we excluded unassignable categories with fewer than three samples from the study, and the distribution of samples in each category is clearly illustrated in Figure 6.
