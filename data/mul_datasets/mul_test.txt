Darvasites|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Darvasites_elliptica_001.jpg|Shell medium,subcylindrical with flat or slightly convex median portions and bluntly pointed poles.The innermost three or four whorls coiled tightly,and the height of the chambers increases gradually outwards.Spirotheca thin,composed of tectum and keriotheca.Septa flute regularly in the lateral slopes and polar portions,with flutings broad and low.Chomata distinct.Proloculus small and spherical.
Eoparafusulina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Eoparafusulina_pseudosimplex_001.jpg|Shell mediun,cylindrical with slightly convex median portions and bluntly rounded poles.Whorls coil tightly and the height of the chambers slowly increases from the inside to the outside whorls.Spirotheca thin and the thickness gradually increases with the growth of Shell.Septa flute regularly in polar and lateral portions with fiutings low and sernicircular,reaching near half of height of chambers.Chornata indistinct Proloculus small and spherical.
Pseudoschwagerina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Pseudoschwagerina_gerontica_001.jpg|Shell large,coarsely fusiform,strongly convex in the center,steeper laterally,bluntly pointed at both poles.Six whorls,initially tightly coiled,markedly relaxed on the outer ring,with a large shell chamber height.Spinnerets composed of dense and honeycomb layers.Segmental folds weak in the inner whorl,strong on the outer ring,forming stacked tile like folds in the middle and lateral parts of the last whorl,spinning ridges only seen in the inner whorl,often missing on the outer whorl.The primary chamber is not clear.
Pseudoschwagerina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Pseudoschwagerina_miharanoensis_003.jpg|Shell medium,highly inflated fusiform with slightly convex lateral slopes and bluntlypointed poleg.The initial one or two whorls tightly coiled,spherical,and outer whorls highly inflated,inflated fusiform.Spirotheca thick.Septa flute slightly in polar portions and outer whorls.Chomata distinct in the innermost two or three whorls.Proloculus large and spherical.
Robustoschwagerina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Robustoschwagerina_fluxa_003.jpg|Shell medium,spherical with slightly concave umbilicus parts.The initial one or two whorls coil a little tightly,and outer ones inflate.The thickmess of the spirotheca gradually increases from the inside to the outside whorls.Septa straight.Chomata small and distinct throughout whole Shell.Proloculus rather large,spherical.
Rugosofusulina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Rugosofusulina_intermedia_001.jpg|Shell medium to large and subcylindrical,slightly arched in the center and bluntly rounded at the poles.Four to five whorls,the envelope relaxing evenly from the inside out.Spin walls two layered,undulating folds especially evident on the outer rim of the spin walls.The septum is only The lower half is folded,and the folds are columnar or semicircular,not quite regular.Spinning ridges are found only in the first whorl.The passage is indistinct and the primary chamber is large.
Sphaeroschwagerina|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Sphaeroschwagerina_borealis_002.jpg|Shell medium,subglobose,poles slightly extended and rounded.Six to seven whorls,fusiform,tightly coiled,outer shell abruptly relaxed,shell shape tapewhorl to coarse juvenile hammer or subglobose,rotational wall thin,rotational wall thickness of outer whorl large,composed of dense layer and honeycomb layer with slender pore structure.The septum is flat in the central and lateral parts,with a simple lattice structure in the polar parts.Spinning ridges are developed as two small black dots in each whorl.The channel is low and narrow on the outer rim,wider on the outer rim,with small primordial chambers.
Zellia|./data/OFG2/predict_img/Zellia_magnae-sphaerae_002.jpg|Shell medium,suhspherical or spherical with slightly concave umbilicus parts.The initial two whorls tightly coil,fusiform,while outer whorls rapidly inflate to subspherical or spherical Spirotheca thin in inner whorls,and gradually increase in thickness outwards.Septa straight.Chomata low but distinct in all whorls or just inner whorls.Proloculus small and spherical.
